This code was used in during a talk I gave to several non-programmers in 2013. The code was designed to demonstrate PHP as an Object Oriented programming language as it is often thought of as a proceedural scripting programming language. 

The example shows how a [Person Object](person.class.php) can be constructed and used within a [View](index.php). This is done similar to a hello world, though it will say hello to the person.
